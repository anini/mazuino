# MAZUINO | Maze Solving Robot, and more!
</div>

### 🔗 https://mazuino.anini.me
<div align="justify">
<b>MAZUINO</b> is an autonomous robot that solves line mazes using an Arduino microcontroller. The robot follows the black line through the maze –without any prior knowledge– until it finds a complete route from start to finish.
<br><br>
While the maze can include multiple dead ends, the robot's first run may involve a few wrong turns. During that run, however, it learns and records the shortest path. On the second run, <b>MAZUINO</b> completes the maze without entering any dead end.
It uses the Left-Hand Rule (aka the wall-follower method) and a custom step-processing algorithm that converts the recorded moves into a new, dead-end-free path.
<br><br>
<b>MAZUINO</b> is not only a maze-solving robot; it also functions as a line follower by default, and it can play music, dance and perform a synchronized light show.
<br><br>
  
Built and developed by <b>[Mohammad Anini](https://anini.me)</b> as a graduation project in 2012. It is worth mentioning that <b>MAZUINO</b> was the first documented maze-solving robot in the Middle East.
